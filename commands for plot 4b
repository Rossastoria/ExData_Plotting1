## The following commands produce the four plots which compose the fourth plot of the assignment.


    ## create a 2 by 2 plotting field
> par(mfrow = c(2,2))   

    ## plot time against active power
> plot(dat$Time, dat$Global_active_power, type = "l", ylab = "Global Active Power (kilowatts)", xlab = "")

    ## plot time against voltage
> plot(dat$Time, dat$Voltage, type = "l", ylab = "Voltage", xlab = "datetime")

    ## plot time against each of the 3 submeters and add a legend
> plot(dat$Time, dat$Sub_metering_1, type = "l", col = "black", xlab = "", ylab = "Energy sub metering")
> legend("topright", col = c("black", "red", "blue"), legend = c("Sub Meter 1", "Sub Meter 2", "Sub Meter 3"), lty = 1, bty = "n", cex = 0.5)
> lines(dat$Time, dat$Sub_metering_2, col = "red")
> lines(dat$Time, dat$Sub_metering_3, col ="blue")

    ## plot time against reactive power
> plot(dat$Time, dat$Global_reactive_power, type = "l", xlab = "datetime", ylab = "Global_active_power")

    ## save the screen device to a png
> dev.copy(png, file = "Plot4b.png")
> dev.off()
