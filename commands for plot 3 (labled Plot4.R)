## These commands produce the thrid plot (of submeters with respect to time), 
## I had some trouble saving the file, and it is here mislabeled as Plot4.R. 

> plot(dat$Time, dat$Sub_metering_1, type = "l", col = "black", xlab = "", ylab = "Energy sub metering")
> lines(dat$Time, dat$Sub_metering_2, col = "red")
> lines(dat$Time, dat$Sub_metering_3, col ="blue")
> legend("topright", col = c("black", "red", "blue"), legend = c("Sub Meter 1", "Sub Meter 2", "Sub Meter 3"), lty = 1)
> dev.copy(png, "Plot3.png")
> dev.off()
